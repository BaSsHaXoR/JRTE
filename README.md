This Library contains files for anyone to add to it and modify willingly at the the respects for the GNU v2.0 License.
At this stage in the Development of "JTMAPI" or "Java-TMAPI" (Java - Target Manager API) for PS3, it is only able to Connect, Attach (Get ProcessID), and SetMemory to the PS3. 

The libraries provided are unfinished, but enough to start the Development of any Java-Related PS3 Modding application.

I highly urge anyone to provide their collaboration to this project, as their is a lot of unfinished code.

WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE:
